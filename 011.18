Extra fields:
- Via will review which fields are the critical fields to finetune (e.g., company) - will get back to me

Parsing code / data cleansing
- Spliting the wage (potentially using $ and then stopping after we dont see a digit or ,.)
- Bullet points
- corrupted symbols

it's ok if i don't finish as much bc of hackathon (next meeting will meet other intern sooo i can spend the time
talking abt my work to her instead of talking abt all the new stuff i did this week); she's doing react

Moving forward:
she doesn't want me to scrape all four after seeing the complexity of my code 
-> instead, just finish scraping this one website and THEN setup aws / database 
and then maybe help out with frontend for careers if i want to (and then if time, continue scraping)
bc what's most important is to get end-to-end product down (don't have to finish everything)
